I'm using an ATMega329PB xplained board with a cheap 0.96" OLED display (SSD1306) in Atmel Studio 7. All written in plain C (no graphic or arduino libraries). There's some other code still in there from other projects but can be ignored for this demo.

The code for rotating the cube is based on code written by Colin Ord (https://sites.google.com/site/colinord) posted on blogspot (http://colinord.blogspot.com/2015/01/arduino-oled-module-with-3d-demo.html)
